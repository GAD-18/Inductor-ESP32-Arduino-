# Inductor-ESP32-Arduino-
# Inductor Lab Project (ESP32 + Arduino IDE)

This project demonstrates the behavior of an *inductor in a circuit* using the ESP32 board programmed with the Arduino IDE.  
The experiment shows how inductors resist changes in current and generate *back EMF* when the current is interrupted.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
- Study the phase difference between voltage and current in an RL circuit.  
- Detect *Back EMF spikes* generated by an inductor.  
- Observe waveforms in simulation (Proteus/Multisim) and compare with ESP32 readings.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Circuit Description
- A resistor and inductor are connected in series.  
- The inductorâ€™s voltage is monitored through a *voltage divider* connected to ESP32 pin *GPIO 35*.  
- Voltage must be scaled to *0â€“3.3V* (safe range for ESP32 ADC).  
- A sine wave (AC source) or pulse generator drives the circuit in simulation.

## ðŸ”¹ ESP32 Code

```cpp
// ESP32 Back EMF Detector (Inductor Lab)
const int emfPin = 35; // Analog pin connected to voltage divider

void setup() { 
  Serial.begin(115200);
}

void loop() {
  int emfValue = analogRead(emfPin);
  
  if (emfValue > 100) { // Threshold to avoid noise
    Serial.print("Back EMF detected! Value: ");
    Serial.println(emfValue);
  } else {
    Serial.println("No significant EMF detected.");
  }

  delay(100);
}
